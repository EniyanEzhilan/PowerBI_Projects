# PowerBI_Projects
This project focuses on analyzing sales performance, gross profitability, and year-over-year trends using an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard provides real-time insights into key business metrics such as Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales, Previous Year-to-Date (PYTD) Sales, Gross Profit (GP%), and Sales Quantity to help businesses optimize their decision-making.
